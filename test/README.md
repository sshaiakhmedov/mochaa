There are two main folders to refer to:

### [Functions](https://github.com/sshaiakhmedov/mochaa/blob/master/index.js)
Here you can see the function code blocks.

### [Tests](https://github.com/sshaiakhmedov/mochaa/blob/master/test/index.spec.js)
That is where all the corresponding tests are located with from mocha and chai libraries.
